Python developers exploring 3D modeling have several standout libraries to choose from in 2024-2025. Open3D is ideal for rapid development in 3D data processing and machine learning, thanks to point cloud manipulation and cross-framework support. Trimesh excels at mesh analysis and manipulation with its lightweight design and robust file handling. Blender's Python API (bpy) unlocks the full power of Blender’s suite for procedural modeling, animation, and rendering, automating industry-standard workflows. Additional options like PyVista and CadQuery cater to scientific visualization and parametric CAD respectively.

Key findings:
- Open3D (https://www.open3d.org/) offers fast, flexible tools for 3D data and ML integration.
- Trimesh (https://trimsh.org/) specializes in mesh operations and file conversions.
- Blender's bpy (https://docs.blender.org/api/current/) provides unparalleled versatility for complete 3D creation and automation.
- PyVista and CadQuery are recommended for scientific and code-based CAD modeling tasks.
