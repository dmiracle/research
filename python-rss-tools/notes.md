# Research Notes

- Initialized python-rss-tools project.
- Initial candidates: feedparser (popular parser), reader (full RSS/Atom aggregator with storage), feedgen (RSS/Atom generator), rss2gen (simple builder), podcastparser (RSS podcast parser), aiofeedparser (async wrapper around feedparser).
- Plan: Provide short code snippets for reading feeds (sync/async), managing feeds with reader, and generating feeds with feedgen/rss2gen.
- Added examples under examples/: feedparser, reader (aggregator with SQLite), feedgen, PyRSS2Gen, podcastparser, aiofeedparser.
- README documents uv-based setup and usage notes for parsing, aggregating, and generating feeds.
