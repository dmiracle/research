- Created project directory `python-async-tools`.
- uv environment present; installed dependencies: trio, anyio, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
- Added placeholder README and gitignore for virtual env/cache artifacts.
- Added backend adapters for asyncio/trio/anyio and benchmark scenarios (task spawn, simulated I/O, cancellation).
- Implemented runner CLI and plotting utilities using pandas/seaborn/matplotlib.
- Adjusted entrypoint to invoke runner.
- Ran benchmarks via `uv run python -m python_async_tools.runner --repetitions 2`, capturing JSON results in results/latest.json.
- Generated plots with `uv run python -m python_async_tools.plotting` -> PNGs under plots/.
- Re-ran benchmarks after tweaking cancellation metrics; regenerated results and plots.
- Observed outcomes: asyncio fastest at raw spawn/cancel; trio slower on spawn but similar per-op latency; anyio sits between asyncio and trio, cancellation faster than trio.
- Drafted README with executive summary, design notes per library, benchmark descriptions, reproduction steps, and embedded plots.
